### Introduction

My name's Will (as you can tell by the name of the blog) and I'm from Chicago. Over the past 12 weeks, I've learned more than during any 12 week stretch in my life, *by far*. You see, around January I made the decision to switch career trajectories from neuroscience academia to data science, so I applied to Metis, a 12 week data science bootcamp with a location here in Chicago. The original plan was to be in-person, but as pandemic lockdowns went into effect, it became clear we would need to shift to remote learning. As I am wont to do, I picked up a new hobby during this time: bird photography!
