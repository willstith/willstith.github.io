### Introduction

My name's Will (as you can tell by the name of the blog) and I'm from Chicago. Over the past 12 weeks, I've learned more than during any 12 week stretch in my life, *by far*. You see, around January I made the decision to switch career trajectories from neuroscience academia to data science, so I applied to Metis, a 12 week data science bootcamp with a location here in Chicago. The original plan was to be in-person, but as pandemic lockdowns went into effect, it became clear we would need to shift to remote learning. As I am wont to do, I picked up a new hobby during this time: birding!

More specifically, bird photography. With plenty of time and surrounded by nature, I quickly amassed over 1000 pictures, and I was eager to share my best shots with my friends and family. But this wasn't easy with so many pictures. I'd often know what bird species I wanted to show someone, but I couldn't remember where in my entire catalog of pictures to find images of that particular species. Wouldn't it be nice if I could automatically sort my photos into folders specific to the species in the photo? Unsurprisingly, such an obscure tool didn't seem available to download anywhere. Good thing I was about to join that data science bootcamp...

My mid-August, after 8 weeks at Metis, I decided I would tackle the problem myself for my final passion project. At this point, I only had about 2 lectures worth of image analysis knowledge under my belt. Suffice it to say I did not really know what I was getting myself into.

### Fine-Grain Image Analysis

The problem I was stumbling into is called fine-grain image analysis, as contrasted with coarse-grain image analysis. Coarse-grain image classification would involve distinguishing between different classes which don't share many visual features (e.g. cars vs. people vs. buildings). Fine-grain image classification, on the other hand, involves distinguishing between different classes which *do* share lots of visual features. In my case, all birds have a beak and 2 wings and 2 legs, and most species just generally have similar body forms. But not only do different bird species look a lot like one another - often individuals of the same species look remarkably different from one another. Here's an example:
